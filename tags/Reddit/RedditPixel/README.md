# Details
This implementation is based on [Simo Ahava's Facebook pixel custom template](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-facebook-pixel-custom-tag-template/) for details about the creation process. You can also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESEtwq7fxc) for a rundown of how the template was built.

The pixel is initialised only once per page so further events will be tracked with the already initialised script.
